# GRS_PA01: Processes and Threads Assignment

This repository contains the implementation for Graduate Systems (CSE638) PA01: Processes and Threads.

## Overview

The assignment consists of four parts:

- **Part A**: Two C programs - one creating processes using fork(), another creating threads using pthreads.
- **Part B**: Three worker functions (cpu, mem, io) that perform intensive computations.
- **Part C**: Bash script to automate measurement of system metrics (CPU%, Memory, I/O) for all combinations.
- **Part D**: Extension of Part C to vary the number of processes/threads and generate plots.

## Files

## Usage

1. Compile the programs:
   ```
   make
   ```

2. Run Part C script:
   ```
   ./MT25022_Part_C_shell.sh
   ```

3. Generate plots for Part D:
   ```
   python3 MT25022_Part_D_plot.py
   ```

4. Clean binaries:
   ```
   make clean
   ```
